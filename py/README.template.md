# H<sub>2</sub>O Nitro

Nitro (N<sub>2</sub>O) is the quickest way to build web apps using Python. No front-end experience required.

## Features

- **No HTML/Javascript.** Build sophisticated multi-page wizard-like workflows and walkthroughs using pure Python.
- **Code.** Laser-focused on keeping application code simple, concise, and clear.
    - **Simplicity.** Page flow follows code flow.
    - **Conciseness.** Lowest lines of code for expressing solutions to a given problem. Less code = less bugs.
    - **Clarity.** Entire apps can be written without jumping through callbacks, request handlers, or event handlers.
- **Widgets.** Huge library of sophisticated, accessible input controls and data visualization.
- **Library.** Nitro is a library, not a server. Integrates with Flask, Tornado, Django, Uvicorn and other frameworks.
  Use it in existing applications.
- **Prototyping-to-production.** Carefully designed API to rapidly prototype new ideas, and progressively improve
  presentation layout and aesthetics over time without affecting initial implementation simplicity, or sacrificing
  control.
- **Unix philosophy.** Tries to do one thing and do it well: display interactive web content. Bring your own web
  app/server of choice and follow their recommendations for hosting, deployment, security, monitoring, metrics and data
  management.

## Differences from H<sub>2</sub>O Wave

**TL;DR:** Use Wave for building visualization-heavy analytical dashboards. For everything else, use Nitro.

- **Deployment.** Nitro is a library, not a server. It's a heavily stripped-down version of Wave with a simpler,
  different API, designed for integration with existing web frameworks.
- **Content Management.** Wave is capable of storing and broadcasting content and data, making it simple to build
  dashboards without having to deal with data management. Nitro has no such features.
- **API.** Wave's API is *dashboard-oriented*, and has several features that make it easy to develop and deploy
  real-time analytics and dashboards easily. Nitro's API is *page-flow-oriented*, and makes it radically simple to
  author sophisticated workflows and wizards without dealing with callback functions and request handlers.
